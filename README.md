# HYPERGRAPHER-A-Data-Visualization-Tool-Java
The growth of data in the present world is drastically increased, where tons of data is produced from different fields. Due to this enormous growth of data, the value of data becomes an important factor in every aspect. It is a complex task for the companies to explore and visualize very large datasets. Every company should follow some protocol to have accurate insight from analysis of large volume of data. This strategy helps organizations to enhance their process and to find the new product and service opportunities that they may have otherwise missed. 

Data visualization is an increasingly important tool for presenting and analysing complex data sets. The ability to create effective data visualizations can help decision makers to quickly and accurately understand patterns and relationships within data, leading to more informed and effective decision making.

This project aims to develop a data visualization tool using Java Servlet and the Chart.js library, which will allow users to create interactive visualizations of their data. The tool will be built using HTML and will be accessible via a web interface. The project will focus on providing a user-friendly interface for data upload and customization of visualizations, allowing users to easily upload their data and customize their visualizations to meet their specific needs. The visualizations will be built using the Chart.js library, which provides a wide range of customizable charts and graphs.

The goal of this project is to create a flexible and easy-to-use data visualization tool that can be used by a wide range of users. By making it easier to analyse and understand complex data, this tool can help to improve decision making and drive more impactful outcomes.
